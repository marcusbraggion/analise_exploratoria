# 1.0 Business Context (ficticious)
House Rocket is a digital platform whose business model is the purchase and sale of real estate using technology.
You are a Data Scientist contracted by the company to help you find the best business opportunities in the real estate market. The CEO of House Rocket would like to maximize the company's revenue by finding good business opportunities.
Their main strategy is to buy good homes in great locations at low prices and then resell them later at higher prices. The greater the difference between buying and selling, the greater the company's profit and therefore the greater its revenue.
However, homes have many attributes that make them more or less attractive to buyers and sellers, and location and time of year can also influence prices.
Therefore, your job as a Data Scientist is to answer the following questions:

# 2.0 Business Problem

## 2.1 Which houses should the House Rocket CEO buy and at what purchase price?

## 2.2 Once the house is in the company's possession, when is the best time to sell it and what would the sale price be?

## 2.3 Should House Rocket do a renovation to raise the sale price? What would be the suggestions for changes? What is the increment in the price given by each reform option?
